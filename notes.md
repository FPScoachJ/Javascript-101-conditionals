## Conditionals in JS

- In Javascript, you have conditionals in the form of the words

```
if...else

if... else if... else (you can have a lot of conditionals here)
```

The syntax we use to write conditionals is as follows:

```
if(this condition is true){
    ... do some code here
}else {
    ... do some other code
}
```

```
if(age >= 21){
    // user can drink
}else {
    // can't drink
}
```

```
if(gpa > 2.9){
    // honor roll
}else if (gpa > 3.4) {
    you get a cool sash
} else if (gpa === 3.9) {
    // magna cum laude
} else {
    // you don't get anything
}
```
